When you run a process in a container it runs on the host system, directly visible as a process on that system. Unlike a Virtual Machine, container is a virtualization at the software level, whereas VMs are virtualization at hardware level.

    "\n",
    "Containers package together a program and all of its dependencies, so that if you have the container you can use it on any Linux system with the container system software installed. It doesn't matter whether the system runs Ubuntu, RedHat or CentOS Linux - if the container system is available then the program runs identically on each, inside its container. This is great for distributing complex software with a lot of dependencies, and ensuring you can reproduce experiments exactly. If you still have the container you know you can reproduce your work. Also since the container runs as a process on the host machine, it can be run very easily in a [SLURM job](https://docs.uabgrid.uab.edu/wiki/Slurm)"

    "\n",
    "[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is the most popular and widely used container system in the industry. But [Singularity](https://www.sylabs.io/singularity/) was built keeping HPC in mind, i.e a shared environment. Singularity is designed so that you can use it within SLURM jobs and it does not violate security constraints on the cluster. Though, since Docker is very popular and a lot of people were already using the Docker for their softwares, Singularity maintained a compatibility for Docker images. We'll be seeing this compatibility later in the notebook. Both Singularity and Docker maintain a hub where you can keep your docker remotely, and pull them from anywhere. Here is a link for both the hubs:\n",
